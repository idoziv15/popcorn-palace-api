## Project Overview
Popcorn Palace API is a movie booking system built using **NestJS** with **TypeORM** and a **PostgreSQL database**.  
The project uses **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for easy setup and deployment.

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**
- **Git**
- **cURL** or **Postman** for API testing

---
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd popcorn_palace_typescript

2. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

3. Create an .env file in the root directory and add the following (or modify existing ones):
     ```bash
     DATABASE_HOST=popcorn-palace-db
     DATABASE_PORT=5432
     DATABASE_USER=popcorn-palace
     DATABASE_PASSWORD=popcorn-palace
     DATABASE_NAME=popcorn-palace

## Running the Project
Start the application using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will:
- Build the API service
- Start the PostgreSQL database
- Run database migrations (if configured)


Once running, the API should be accessible at:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

To stop the project:
press ```^c```

then:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Testing the API
Run tests inside the container

```bash
docker exec -it popcorn-palace-api npm test
```

Run tests locally (if dependencies are installed)

```bash
npm run test
```

### Environment Variables
The application uses an .env file to configure database settings. Hereâ€™s what the .env file should contain:
```
DATABASE_HOST=popcorn-palace-db
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USER=popcorn-palace
DATABASE_PASSWORD=popcorn-palace
DATABASE_NAME=popcorn-palace
APP_PORT=3000
```
Modify these values as needed.

### Common Issues & Fixes
1. Error: "Postgres package has not been found installed"

     Fix: Ensure the pg package is installed inside the container.

```bash
docker exec -it popcorn-palace-api npm install pg
```

2. Error: "Cannot connect to database"

     Fix: Ensure the database container is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

### Testing the API
To ensure the Popcorn Palace API is functioning correctly, you can run different types of tests. There are unit tests and e2e tests i provided for this API.
You can run the test file like that:
- Make sure the API is running (after docker-compose up --build command)
- then sinple open another terminal and run:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it <the_api_container_name> npx jest src/test --runInBand --verbose
     ```
- Replace <the_api_container_name> with your acutal container name.
